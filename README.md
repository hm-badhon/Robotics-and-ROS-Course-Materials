    - **C++ for Robotics   :** 
    - [Link to Course](https://app.theconstructsim.com/courses/59)
    - Time Duration - 18 Hours

        Do you want to become a ROS Developer? If the answer is yes, then learning C++ is mandatory for you.

        C++ is one of the most popular programming languages for robots, especially when working with industrial or non-educational robots.

        In the C++ for Robotics course, you will master essential C++ knowledge in order to get started with ROS smoothly.

Remember that variables are like storage space for interesting data. We are going to use variables to store sensor data and manipulate it to understand the current situation of the robot. Additionally, you will learn how to add comments to the code..

        2. **Conditional Statements & Loops:**
                        - Learn some more advanced tools that are going to allow you to create more complex and interesting programs. Specifically, you are going to learn about conditional statements and loops.

                        - Learn some more advanced tools that are going to allow you to create more complex and interesting programs. Specifically, you are going to learn about functions.

        5. **Arrays and Pointers:**
                        - Learn a particular tool of C++: pointers. We are going to present how variables are stored in the memory of the computer, and how can we access this memory with pointers.

        6. **C++ Classes:**
                        - Learn how to organize your code properly to prevent messy code when things get complicated (that usually happens when working with robots). The organization method/principle used in C++ is called Object-Oriented Programming and it is based on the concept of C++ classes.
